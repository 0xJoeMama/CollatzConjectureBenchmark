# Collatz Conjecture Benchmark
Single/multi core benchmark for Windows.

# Building the project

I am using CLion to develop this project. However if you are not you can still build it:

Steps for build:
- Install `cmake` and `make`.
- Execute the `build.sh` script.
```shell
$ ./build.sh
```
- You are done!
